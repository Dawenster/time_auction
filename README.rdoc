== Time Auction
Time Auction was started in 2007 by David Wen as a series of live auctions in Canada. It has raised 7,000 hours to date on $10,000 in product donations.

In 2013, Dev Bootcamp students David Wen <a href="https://www.github.com/Dawenster">(Github)</a>, Kevin Ko <a href="https://www.github.com/heyimkko">(Github)</a>, Philip Woo <a href="https://www.github.com/jhw1202">(Github)</a>, and J Connolly<a href="https://www.github.com/jsconnolly">(Github)</a> took this offline project and converted it into a full-fledged rails app as their final projects.
