#Time Auction
Time Auction was started in 2007 by David Wen as a series of live auctions in Canada. It has raised 7,000 hours to date on $10,000 in product donations.

In 2013, Dev Bootcamp students [David Wen](https://www.github.com/Dawenster), [Kevin Ko](https://www.github.com/heyimkko), [Philip Woo](https://www.github.com/jhw1202), and [J Connolly](https://www.github.com/jsconnolly) took this offline project and converted it into a full-fledged rails app as their final projects.
